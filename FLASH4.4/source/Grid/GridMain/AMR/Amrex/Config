# add pre-processor symbol FLASH_GRID_AMREX
PPDEFINE FLASH_GRID_AMREX

# We need to use the Fortran 2003 module named iso_c_binding in
# the FLASH I/O unit.  This is not an extra dependency
# because the interoperability of pointers already
# depends on this module.  We do not define USE_IO_C_INTERFACE
# in any other Config file because non-Chombo FLASH applications
# with I/O only optionally depend on the iso_c_binding module.
#PPDEFINE USE_IO_C_INTERFACE
