# DEVNOTE: TEMPORARY SITUATION
# there are three setup/runtime "scenarios" or "modes":
# (1) defined(FLASH_GRID_PARAMESH);
# (2) defined(FLASH_GRID_PARAMESH) && defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREXTRANSITION);
# (3) defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREX)

# add pre-processor symbol FLASH_GRID_AMREX
PPDEFINE FLASH_GRID_AMREX

# The following is defined for AMR/Amrex and .../AmrexTransition as well
# Here defined(FLASH_GRID_ANYAMREX) == (defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREX) ||
#                                       defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREXTRANSITION))
PPDEFINE FLASH_GRID_ANYAMREX

# We need to use the Fortran 2003 module named iso_c_binding in
# the FLASH I/O unit.  This is not an extra dependency
# because the interoperability of pointers already
# depends on this module.  We do not define USE_IO_C_INTERFACE
# in any other Config file because non-Chombo FLASH applications
# with I/O only optionally depend on the iso_c_binding module.
#PPDEFINE USE_IO_C_INTERFACE

# !!! If you add a parameter, please add a description line
# Format is D <parameter name> <description>

D gr_amrex_verbosity How much output is written out. Higher number is more verbose.
PARAMETER gr_amrex_verbosity INTEGER 1 [ 0 ... ]
