# (1) defined(FLASH_GRID_PARAMESH);
# (2) defined(FLASH_GRID_PARAMESH) && defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREXTRANS);
# (3) defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREX)

# add pre-processor symbol FLASH_GRID_AMREX

# Temporarily create for ../AmrexTransition only
# DEVNOTE: The following may be a misunderstanding and should disappear from here - KW
# DEVNOTE: not to be confused with FLASH_GRID_AMREXTRANSITION, which should NOT be defined here.
PPDEFINE FLASH_GRID_AMREXTRANS
# The following is defined for AMR/Amrex and .../AmrexTransition as well
# Here defined(FLASH_GRID_ANYAMREX) == (defined(FLASH_GRID_AMREX) ||

PPDEFINE FLASH_GRID_ANYAMREX

# We need to use the Fortran 2003 module named iso_c_binding in
# the FLASH I/O unit.  This is not an extra dependency
# because the interoperability of pointers already
# depends on this module.  We do not define USE_IO_C_INTERFACE
# in any other Config file because non-Chombo FLASH applications
# with I/O only optionally depend on the iso_c_binding module.
#PPDEFINE USE_IO_C_INTERFACE

# !!! If you add a parameter, please add a description line
# Format is D <parameter name> <description>

D How much output is written out. Higher number is more verbose.
