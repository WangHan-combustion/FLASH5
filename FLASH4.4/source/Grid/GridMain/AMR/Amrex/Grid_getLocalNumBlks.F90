!!
!! NAME
!!  Grid_getLocalNumBlks
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  Grid_getLocalNumBlks(integer(OUT) :: numBlocks)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!  Get the number of local blocks on a processor
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!  numBlocks : The number of blocks currently in use on myProcessor
!!
!! NOTES
!!  There should be a better (more efficient) way to do this!
!!  The current version iterates through a loop and counts interations.
!!  There should be (and maybe already is) a better way to get the
!!  information directly from AMReX.
!!
!!  The blocks counted include LEAF as well as covered blocks.
!!  This is consistent with the functionality of the
!!  PARAMESH version, and used in this way in the friendly IO unit.
!!
!!  An alternative version Grid_getLocalNumLeafBlks is coded below,
!!  but currently (2018-02-26) not yet made public via Grid_interface.
