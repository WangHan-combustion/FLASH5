!! NAME
!!  Grid_initDomain
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!  Grid_initDomain(logical(IN)    :: restart,
!!                  logical(INOUT) :: particlesInitialized)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!  Create the coarsest mesh, initialize all the mesh data structures,
!!  apply initial conditions, and run EoS on interior and guardcells to make
!!  them thermodynamically consistent.
!!
!!  User-defined refinement critera is applied to determine the 
!!  blocks that require refinement.  All new child blocks are filled
!!  with the initial conditions, guardells are filled for cell-centered
!!  variables, and EoS is run on interiors and guardcells.
!!
!!  In simulations with particles, under certain conditions particle
!!  positions will also be initialized.  Currently this is the case
!!  if and only if the runtime parameter refine_on_particle_count is
!!  true.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!  restart : is true if the execution is starting from a checkpoint
!!            file, otherwise false.
!!  particlesInitialized : is true if particle positions were initialized before returning
!!                         from this routine
!!
!! NOTES
!!  When restarting from a checkpoint file, block interiors are assumed to
!!  have been filled when this interface is called. The EOS is not called on
!!  the block interiors in this implementation for use with Paramesh. It is
!!  assumed that data is already thermodynamically consistent, because
!!  that is how data are written to checkpoint files.

  ! (a coarse level and the next finest level).  Following the AMReX 
  ! interface and the AMReX tutorials, the 0-based level index used here
  ! is associated with the level index of the fine level 
  !    (e.g. flux_register(1) is the flux register for the coarse level 0
  !          and the fine level 1).
